				<p>The importance of informal, non-classroom exposion to learning opportunities in STEM cannot be overstated. Experiences provided by parents, friends, and informal educators inspire and expose students to the wonder and possibility of science in everyday life. NM EPSCoR is proud to sponsor the New Mexico Informal Science Education Network (NM ISE Net) in order to provide opportunities and resrouces for informal educators (including the <a href="#TeacherInst">Summer Teacher Institute</a>) to work together to impact science teaching, science learning, and science awareness throughout the state.</p>
                <p>In Year 2, the Network focused on building their capacity to effectively communicate science to the public. This included participation in the "Reflecting the Practice" coaching workshop facilitiated by the <a href="http://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/">Lawrence Hall of Science</a>; the workshop provided training and tools to imporve the practice of informal science educators, and facilitated the formation of a Community of Practice of informal science instututions and practitioners in New Mexico. NM ISE Net is systematically linking members of their communities not only to other informal education institutions, but also to academic research efforts, faculty presentations, and the New Mexico Public Education Department.</p>

				<div class="block-9">
				<p>Science teachers and their students wrestle with energy concepts at nearly every grade level. What is energy? Where does New Mexico’s energy come from? Is energy from the sun different from the energy that powers our everyday lives, from our cars to our bodies? The <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/framework-k%E2%80%9312-science-education">Framework for K–12 Science Education</a> provides a foundation for K–12 teaching and learning about energy as a crosscutting concept across the disciplines. Educators from five NM ISE Net institutions used the Framework to develop and present the first Energize New Mexico Teacher Institute, held in Albuquerque on June 9&ndash;13, 2014.</p>  
				<p>In order to facilitate future implementation, teachers attended the Institute as part of a school team that included principals. Twenty-six elementary school teachers from three school districts increased their conceptual understanding of energy and learned strategies for exploring energy with their students. Highlights from the week include the construction of roller coasters and waterwheels, exploration of New Mexico’s energy resources, and children’s literature connections.</p> 
                <p>The Institute encouraged teachers to “think outside the box” when it comes to teaching and learning about energy. Institute participants are supported by NM ISE Net educators throughout the school year, and all participants attended the New Mexico Science Teachers Association conference in Fall 2014.</p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="block-9">
				<p>Creative Startups is the first accelerator designed by and for creative entrepreneurs. Over 40 successful business owners in creative fields were tapped and engaged as mentors, and new curriculum modules were completed and tested in Summer 2014. The 10 modules includedleadership of new ventures, financing for startups, marketing and branding, and legal
issues. In its first year, Creative Startups received 60 applications from entrepreneurs in various creative fields—80% were submitted by women- and/or minority-owned startups. 12 finalists were chosen (9 women/minority-owned) for the 2014 Creative Startups Accelerator cohort.</p>
				<p>After participating in the 10 online modules, the cohort began a week-long “Deep Dive” in which 30+ mentors and community leaders joined the cohort to provide advice, deliver technical assistance, and network with the entrepreneurs, while community events brought nearly 200 people to network and engage in the startup ecosystem. Across the
board, the 2014 Accelerator had a positive impact on participating startups.</p>
				<p>Creative Startups continues to grow the ecosystem of resources for creative entrepreneurs, including partnering to bring two international programs to Albuquerque: Creative Mornings and 99U/Behance.</p>

				<p>The STEM Advancement Program (STEMAP) engages students from New Mexico regional universities, community colleges and tribal colleges in the research funded
by NM EPSCoR. STEMAP gives undergraduates from these non-research universities the opportunity to work in the labs of NM EPSCoR researchers, an opportunity these students may not otherwise have access to. The nine-week commitment involves one week of training and eight weeks of research, followed by a final conference at which the students present their research. In return, the students receive a stipend, housing and food allowances, and 3 hours of independent study credits from NMT. Students also receive support during the academic year with additional opportunities to build skills in STEM research and communication.</p>
<p>On June 2, 2014, eleven undergraduates from seven New Mexico primarily undergraduate institutions reported to NMT to begin their STEMAP participation. The program ended July 30, 2014 with student presentations to 50+ researchers, faculty, friends, family,and NM EPSCoR staff at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Three STEMAP students, Tim Torres, Aysha McClory and Saul Ruiz, accepted invitations to present their research at the 2014 SACNAS Conference, and several participants are now pursuing STEM degrees directly because of their experience with STEMAP. More testimonials about STEMAP 2014 can me seen on the <a href="https://youtu.be/EPGbgY1LgjA?list=PLr7S80asPQD641aSs1IsCJZGCj0lLSugq">NM EPSCoR YouTube page</a>.</p>

				<p>For two days in September 2014, the Faculty Leadership and Professional Development Institute (FLPDI) continued to work with new curriculum from Micromessaging
to Reach and Teach Every Student&trade; from the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity (NAPE). Undergraduate faculty from 12 institutions learned to use research-tested pedagogy that improves enrollment, retention, and completion of girls and underrepresented populations in STEM courses. An online follow-up session furthered the discussion of how culture shapes our biases and beliefs about people, often without our realization.</p>

					<h4>Increasing non-PhD granting institutions’ capacity to provide quality research experiences for students</h4>

				<p>The intent of the Infrastructure Seed Grant (ISG) program is to increase the access of undergraduate students, especially women and members of underrepresented groups, to research experiences by increasing non-PhD granting institutions’ capacity to provide these experiences for students. Two ISG awards were implemented in Year 2.</p>
                <p>At New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU), the ISG award was used to acquire instrumentation for analysis of the temperature and heat-energy transfer of materials, and for obtaining large crystalline samples of materials. This involved differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a method that can be used to measure a number of characteristic properties
of materials for understanding phase (gas-liquid-solid) changes and whether materials can store energy in a certain phase. Two faculty members, two graduate students, and two undergraduate students are involved in research related to charge transfer materials and metal organic frameworks with luminescent properties. The team has submitted three proposals to NSF and one to
the Department of Energy that will employ instrumentation acquired through this award. The instrumentation is also included in laboratory components of Physical and Analytical Chemistry courses at NMHU.</p>
				<p>The Santa Fe Community College (SFCC) ISG provided funding for sensors used by students focused on monitoring the commercial-scale photobioreactors at the SFCC Biofuels laboratory. Students study how pH, operating temperatures, chlorophyll content and other parameters affect the maximum algae production and biomass densities. The new sensors allow students and faculty to replicate growth conditions optimized in a lab setting to determine if they can be scaled up to industrial production levels. Capturing data in real time under continuous operation allows researchers to determine the performance of the photobioreactors and optimizes long-term microalgal biomass productivity.</p>
