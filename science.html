					<p>New Mexico is known as the Land of Enchantment - a place of great beauty, abundant natural resrouces, and rich cultural diversity.
						The state has great potential for leading the nation in sustainable energy development, and Energize New Mexico is paving the way.
						The Science Teams are studying how to increase efficiency of resource utilization &amp; extractive technolgies, and whether water 
						and enivronmental resources can sustain extractive energy development with little to no risk.</p>

				<p>At UNM, the Bioalgal team is pursuing novel ways to culture cells while maintaining photosynthetic function. The team found that encapsulating living algae cells with bacterium generates electricity better than just algae or bacteria alone. </p>
<p>Also during Year 2, the NMSU team worked on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a process that converts algae into a liquid biofuel that can be used either directly as energy or as materials to help fuel wastewater decontamination and utilization. A particular species of algae, <i>Galdieria sulphuraria</i>, demonstrated removal of contaminants and a decrease in the quantity of oxygen used by microorganisms in primary-settled wastewater. As a result, the NMSU team recently completed deployment of an algal-based wastewater treatment system in partnership with the Las Cruces Wastewater Treatment Facility.

				<div class="block-9">
					
						<p>In year 2, the Geothermal team worked towards a better understanding of underlying hydrothernal systems in New Mexico by locating and mapping blind systems and creating a statewide database of these systems (click button on the left for more). Team members and students received training on the EPSCoR-funded, state-of-the-art Zonge magnetotelluric (MT) system, which will help the team detect possible geothermal structures underground. The MT system also allows for estimation of geothermal reservoir temperatures at various depths. </p>
						<p><i>Energize New Mexico</i> funding also allowed for an inter-institutional graduate level course, "Geothermal Energy: Tectonic setting, exploration, production, and sustainability." The class provided a unique opportunity to combine research with education as students were actively involved and engaged in the geothermal team's research activities.</p>
